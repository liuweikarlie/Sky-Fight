## Description of the Game
Sky Fight is a text-based plane war game that the player ( one player ) controls the direction of the plane to avoid the collision with enemy’s plane.

1. In the game, the player is able to shoot the enemy with their bullet continually. Each time, as the bullets are shot and kill one enemy’s plane, the player can earn points according to the enemy's type. 

2. As for the enemy plane, different size/type of the enemy are killed by different numbers of bullet shots. The largest plane is killed by 15 bullets (earn 30 points), the middle planes need 10 bullets(earn 20 points), and the smallest one needs 5 bullets(earn 10 points). 

3. Within fixed timing (eg. 20 sec),the number of enemy planes and enemy types are generated by the computer programme. 
  *(eg. time interval = 3s, release number = (1-3), plane type random )*

4. The game will end until the player are crushed with an enemy

5. At the game end, the score and the ranking according to history records will be displayed on the screen.
 
6. The player controls the direction with arrow symbols from the keyboard.

## Function and Feature of the game
 
- The number of the enemy plane within 1 second is computing by random generator 
   **[Generation of random game sets or events]**
 
- The total number of the enemy plane is undefined for every trial. This game will utilize pointer and structure, class for unfixed plane numbers. 
   **[Dynamic memory management]**
 
- The points get by the player and the number of enemy killed will be store in the arrays
  **[Data structures for storing game status]**
 
- In order to make ranking and store the history result, it needs to have file input and output to make results comparison and sorting. 
**[File input/output]**


- For the whole programme design, it includes several files **[Multiple files]**: Main.cpp, player.h, player.cpp, enemy.h, enemy.cpp, (explosion struct, bullet struct) 
  - Main (Battleground)
    - Background (initialize/reset)
      - Clear bg
      - Generate random release no. and types  [Generation of random game sets or events]
      - Set up release linked list [Dynamic memory management]
      - Draw functions (Draw player, enemies)
