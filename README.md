## Description of the Game
Sky Fight is a text-based plane war game that the player ( one player ) controls the direction of the plane to avoid the enemy’s plane to hit you.
1. Within the game, the player is able to shoot the enemy with their bullet continually. Each time, as the bullets are shot and kill one enemy’s plane, the player can earn points ( 10 points ). *(Eg.2 shots per seconds)*

2. As for the enemy plane, different sizes of the enemy are killed by different numbers of bullet shots. The largest plane is killed by 15 bullets, the middle planes need 10 bullets, and the smallest one needs 5 bullets. *(adjust with the speed of falling)*

3. Within fixed timing (eg. 20 sec), there is a special prize that allows the plane to double bullets shot for each time.
The number of enemy planes and types are generated by the computer programme. 
  *(eg. time interval = 3s, release number = (1-3), plane type random )*

4. The game will end until you are crushed with an enemy

5. At the game end, the result and the ranking which rank with the history records will be displayed on the screen.
 
6. The player controls the direction with arrow symbols from the keyboard.
